# Base64 Decoder

Simple Python script to decode Base64 encoded texts back to their original format.

## Description

This repository contains a Python script that decodes Base64 encoded texts. It serves as a quick tool to convert Base64 encoded strings into their original text format using Python's built-in `base64` module.

## Features

- Decodes Base64 encoded texts to their original plain text format.
- Simple command-line interface for easy usage.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/nome-do-repositorio.git
   cd nome-do-repositorio
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if not already installed.

### Usage

1. Navigate to the directory where the script `base64_decoder.py` is located.

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python base64_decoder.py
   ```

3. Enter the Base64 encoded text when prompted.

4. The script will decode the text and display the original plain text.

5. To exit the script, type 'q' when prompted for the Base64 encoded text.

### Example

Suppose you have a Base64 encoded text `SGVsbG8gV29ybGQhIQ==`. Running the script with this input will produce:
```
Enter Base64 encoded text (or 'q' to quit): SGVsbG8gV29ybGQhIQ==
Decoded text: Hello World!!
```
